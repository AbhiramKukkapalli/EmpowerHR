#  HRM System with RFID Integration

This HRM (Human Resource Management) system is designed to streamline employee management processes and facilitate attendance tracking within an organization. It consists of two main components: a .NET desktop application for administrative use and a web application for other employees. Additionally, an Arduino Uno RFID reader is integrated into the system to enable employee card reading.

## Features
### Admin Desktop Application:

User-friendly interface for HR administrators to manage employees, departments, and attendance records.
Functionality to add, update, and delete employee information, including personal details, contact information, and employment history.
Department management features, including creating and editing departments, assigning employees, and managing department-specific data.
Attendance tracking and reporting capabilities, allowing administrators to monitor employee attendance, generate reports, and analyze data.

### Employee Web Application:

Web-based interface accessible to employees for accessing personal information, submitting leave requests, and viewing attendance records.
Employee self-service features, including updating personal details, managing leave requests, and viewing leave balances.
Notifications and reminders related to leave requests, approvals, and upcoming events.
Real-time visibility of attendance records, allowing employees to monitor their attendance history.
### RFID Integration:

Integration of an Arduino Uno RFID reader into the system to enable card reading functionality.
Employees can use RFID cards to log attendance, clock in and out, and access certain areas or resources within the organization.
RFID card data is captured by the Arduino Uno reader and transmitted to the HRM system for processing and recording attendance information.
### Technologies Used
- .NET Framework for the desktop application.
- ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core MVC for the web application.
- Entity Framework for database access and management.
- Arduino Uno with RFID reader for card reading functionality.
